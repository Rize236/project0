# project0
There is no project at the moment. This area is essentially just to pile up idea's of what I CAN do with the knowledge that I'm gaining while learning javascript, css and pther programming languages.

Basically, my goals are as follows:
1. Set up a website
2. Customize it via CSS
3. Create a login system
4. Create a news feed (where posts can be made to be displayed on main page)
5. Simple and elegant comment system (anonymous(no registration required) or user-made posts)
6. Improve all of the above aspects (debugging, new modifications and whatever else I can come up with)

I'm going to try and accomplish this by using online HTML5, CSS and Javascript (some SQL as well for database purposes)
